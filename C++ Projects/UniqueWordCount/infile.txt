line  1 - let's say you are seeking enlightenment ... 
line  2 - and you get to the very LAST step ... 
line  3 - but you know that "wanting" to take this step, will forever prevent you from taking it ... 
line  4 - so you release the "want" ... 
line  5 - but having NO "want" to take the step, will you take it? 
line  6 - when Truth realization does awaken within you 
line  7 - you will see that a step in any direction, with the "intent" to find Truth, 
line  8 - is a step in the wrong direction ... 
line  9 - it leads you away from where you are ... 
line 10 - thus the pursuit is based entirely on the premiss 
line 11 - that where you are is wrong, and that you need to be somewhere else ... 
line 12 - and you need to move to where it is you believe you need to be ... 
line 13 - but the fact of the matter is that you are already there ... 
line 14 - you need only realize it ...
